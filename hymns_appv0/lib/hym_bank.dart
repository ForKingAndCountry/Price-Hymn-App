title: 'To Be Closed to thee,',
stanza: '''1.) Lord, I long to be close to Thee
Ever be with Thee for my life to change,
There Thy thoughts and nature is known,
And my life moulded to become like Thee.

2.) My heart yearns to be close to Thee
And get lost in Thy everlasting love,
Kiss me with the kisses of Thy mouth,
Elope now with me to Thy dwelling place

3.) My pursuit is to dwell with Thee
Then Thy thought and plans and burden is known;
Sharp utterance meet to strike my age,
Are received only when I am with Thee.

4.) O, Lord, when I am close to Thee,
Sin and the world cannot set us apart,
Temptations receive their defeat,
When â€˜m always close, abiding with Thee

5.) O, what peace, to be close to Thee,
No more confusion, my worry is gone
Faith and boldness in Thee is sure,
And vision is clear when I stay with Thee.

6.) Lord, ever keep me close to Thee,
Never let me stay from thy loving grip;
Am fully released to Thy Arm
Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings.

''',
chorus: ''' O My God, to be close to Thee
Is my cry and desire day long
Nothing counts but to be with Thee
Then Thy face I see and Thy life received.'''
